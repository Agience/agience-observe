## Teams transcript ingestion

When you open a Teams meeting recap page (`teams.microsoft.com`), the extension automatically intercepts the API call that loads the transcript. When a presigned transcript URL is detected in the response:

1. The transcript file (`.vtt` or `.docx`) is downloaded from the presigned URL (Microsoft pre-signs it).
2. A new artifact is created in your Agience workspace with `content_type: text/plain`.
3. A toast notification confirms the capture.

The transcript is captured once per page load. No data is sent until a transcript URL is detected.
